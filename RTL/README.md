These are all the VHDL files that may be needed to synthesize or simulate DOGPU.
+ This version of FGPU operates on a single clock.
+ The top level file is FGPU_vliw.vhd
+ A model for the global memory is included (global_mem.vhd)
+ The files FGPU_hbm_tb.vhd and FGPU_simulation_pkg.vhd are needed only for simulation.
